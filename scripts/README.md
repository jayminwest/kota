# KOTA Scripts

This directory is intended to hold utility scripts (Bash, Python, etc.) that interact with your KOTA system or perform other automated tasks.

You can call these scripts manually or potentially trigger them via Aider (depending on Aider's capabilities and your setup). See `scripts/mcp_example.sh` for an example of how a script might interact with an MCP server.
